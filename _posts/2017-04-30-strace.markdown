# Strace

# System Call
System calls is the interface of your operating system. Whether or not you are aware, the app you write is really issuing a number of these system calls to perform different actions: making a http request, writing a csv file etc.

## The open system call
To see what files your app is opening:
`strace -e open cat hello.txt`

## The write system call
To see what files are being written to:
`strace -e write echo 'hello' > important.txt`

## The connection system call
To show every IP your app connects to:
`strace -e connect`

## Inbound/outbound network activity 
To debug network activity, perhaps a http service
`strace -e sendto`
`strace -e recvfrom`

## execve
To find out what cmd is being executed with with args
`strace -e execve`
